# Assessing the Influence of Sensor-Induced Noise on Machine Learning-Based Changeover Detection in CNC Machines

The Noise in the sensor data has a substantial impact on the reliability and accuracy of ML algorithms. A comprehensive framework is proposed to analyze the effect of diverse noise inputs in sensor data on the accuracy of ML models. Through extensive experimentation and evaluation, this research examines the resilience of a LightGBM ML model to ten different noise models, namely Flicker, Impulse, Gaussian, Brown, Periodic, and others.  We followed a thorough analytical approach with various statistical metrics in a Monte Carlo simulation setting. We found that the Gaussian and Colored noise were detrimental when compared to Flicker and Brown, which are identified as safe noise categories. It was interesting to find a safe threshold limit of noise intensity for the case of Gaussian noise, which was missing in other noise types. This research work employs the use case of changeover detection on CNC manufacturing machines and the corresponding data from the publicly funded research project OBerA
